# Server-Based-File-System
A simulated file system that connects to a server and writes, deletes, or alters data depending on the user's request.
This project was done as a team project with Grant Weikel and John Munar.
Written in C++

Simulates how blocks are used to store data in a file system. The user can write data which will be stored in blocks just like how a computers storage actually operates. This data can be altered or deleted. Data can be added until the system runs out of space to put it. The file system is run on a server, which the user must connected to by inputting the correct port number that the server is running on.
